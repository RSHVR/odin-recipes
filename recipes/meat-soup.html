    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Voluptate in id quae, animi nesciunt odio obcaecati
        pariatur sunt praesentium, earum ratione nobis vero impedit molestiae qui sapiente velit non itaque.</p>

    <h2> Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8-12 cups of water</li>
        <li>Â½ kg meat (pork, beef, lamb, chicken, hen etc)</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>3-5 cups of herb such as the top shoots of stinging nettles, young dandelion leaves,
            wild chervil, cress, wild marjorum, dill, plantain, angelica, wild onions, caraway greenery,
            thyme, or whatever the season has to offer.</li>
    </ul>




    <strong>Remember: You must always be sure that the plants are edible!</strong>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>Meat</dt>
        <dd>Put the meat in the kettle. Pour water over the meat so it is covered and put the kettle on the
            fire. In order that the heat is spread evenly the kettle must be turned about every 5-10
            minutes. When the water boils it should cook for about one hour. It may be necessary to add
            more water so the meat is always covered with water.</dd>

        <dt>Herbs</dt>
        <dd>While the meat is cooking wash and chop the herbs. They will go in the soup when it is ready.
            When the meat is tender take it out and slice it to a size fit for a spoon and return it to the
            soup. Add salt as desired, then it is ready to be served. It can be served with flatbread.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>If you want a more filling soup you can add soaked wheat kernels, thick flour... or the soup
        can be smoothed out with pea flour (yellow peas grinded on a stone).</p>
